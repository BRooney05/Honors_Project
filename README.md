Ideas:
Back/Home buttons (placed on every screen?)
Flashing help text
Leaderboard with wins
Change to scaling play text
Random pairs
Scaling boat
Fix image conversion
Use recursion and week counter to track weeks/loss
Music slider/switch
Text size dependant on screen size

Sprite Class Keys:
Initialize with super, image, rect, and default values if applicable
Add all methods that cause sprites to do something
Update method to call all other methods
If animating, make list of frames that are already imported in init, make animation method
If multiple types, use type parameter in init
